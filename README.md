## Reporting 
   After successful test run, you can find information about the tests in the directory of the repository. From there you will find a folder "net6.0" which leads to another folder "TodoReport" and contains file "index.html". Open to see which tests have failed on a specific step (if there are any), and which have passed!
   
## Feature
  The Feature file (living documentation) can be found in the "Features" folder of the project.
